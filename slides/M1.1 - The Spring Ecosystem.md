# Understanding the Spring Ecosystem

In this lesson, we'll go through the main modules that Spring offers and understand how they relate to each other to form the Spring ecosystem.

## The Popularity of Spring
Let's start with understanding what Spring actually is. Simply put, Spring is a [back-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) technology with a broad range of uses, the most common being the development of web applications.

Spring is also a very general term which can refer to the core of the framework, but most often, it refers to the whole family of Spring-related projects.

Spring was originally built in response to the complexity of developing with [J2EE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/appmodel-135059.html) / Java EE, let's compare it with that: [Spring Framework - Java EE Google Search Trend Comparison](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F0dhx5b,Java%20EE)

Backend technologies (such as the Spring Framework) are also propelled by the massive increase in popularity of edge-cloud technologies and microservice architecture.

[OReilly's Technology Trends for 2024](../books/oreilly-technology-trends-2024.pdf) also shows how Java Technologies related to cloud software engineering and microservices architectures are extremely relevant.



Another indication of Spring's popularity is the number of questions on StackOverflow for Spring compared to other related Java technologies:

-   [Hibernate Questions (77k)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hibernate)
-   [Maven Questions (66k)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/maven)
-   [Tomcat Questions (37k)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tomcat)
-   [Servlets Questions (31k)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/servlets)

## Why Use Spring?
The early goal of Spring, and still a core guideline of the framework, is removing complexity, clutter and boilerplate code. Basically, Spring aims to make building a system easier for developers. This is a monumental task, and one that, solved correctly, can make a huge impact.

Spring is also not an all or nothing choice. You can actually pick and choose the parts of Spring that make sense for your system.

An interesting aspect of Spring is how much of a long-term investment learning Spring actually is, as its evolution is quite unique. On the one hand, it's actively developed and always improving at the edges. But, at the core, it's highly highly stable. In fact, it's so stable that learning the core of Spring 10 years ago would, with small exceptions, still be relevant today.

[This article](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-reasons-why-it-is-worth-learning-spring-boot-in-2023-fd06bf833de8) underlines the key factors behind Spring relevance:
* Spring Remains Viable, And Its Track Record Of Staying Current And Relevant Is Impressive
* The Ecosystem Integrates With Existing Popular Libraries
* Spring Is Everywhere — Personal Or Corporate
* Spring Boots Testability
* Monitoring And Observability
* Simplicity And Rapid Development
* Microservice Support
* Embedded Servers
* Spring Boot Is Open Source
* Community And Support


## The Spring Ecosystem
Due to the success of the framework, the Spring ecosystem grew over time.

This is now quite vast, as you can see on the [official site](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework).

### Spring Core
* Core technologies: dependency injection, events, resources, i18n, validation, data binding, type conversion, SpEL, AOP.
* Testing: mock objects, TestContext framework, Spring MVC Test, WebTestClient.
* Data Access: transactions, DAO support, JDBC, ORM, Marshalling XML.
* Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux web frameworks.
* Integration: remoting, JMS, JCA, JMX, email, tasks, scheduling, cache and observability.

### Spring Data
Spring Data’s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.

* Powerful repository and custom object-mapping abstractions
* Dynamic query derivation from repository method names
* Implementation domain base classes providing basic properties
* Support for transparent auditing (created, last changed)

### Spring Cloud
Spring Cloud focuses on providing good out of box experience for typical use cases and extensibility mechanism to cover others.

* Distributed/versioned configuration
* Service registration and discovery
* Routing
* Service-to-service calls
* Load balancing
* Circuit Breakers
* Distributed messaging
* Short-lived microservices (tasks)
* Consumer-driven and producer-driven contract testing

### Spring Security
Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.

* Comprehensive and extensible support for both Authentication and Authorization
* Protection against attacks like session fixation, clickjacking, cross site request forgery, etc
* Servlet API integration
* Optional integration with Spring Web MVC

## Spring Boot
As the Spring ecosystem grew it became more complex. Over time, the Spring team made a few attempts to simplify Spring development according to the initial purpose, such as Spring Roo and the Groovy integration.

**Spring Boot** changed everything about developing with Spring by taking an opinionated view and providing sensible defaults. Simply put, **Boot represents a layer of abstraction on top of the Spring framework**. **The goal is simplifying the development of a Spring application.** Compared to standard Spring, getting a simple application up-and-running with Boot is very quick.

Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that comes with default configuration with an opinionated take on building web application with Spring. Before Boot, a Spring application needed a lot of configuration just to get started. Using Boot eliminates a lot of [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code).

However, the default configuration that Boot brings may not always be what we need. In this case, we can also add our own configuration. Boot will intelligently back off and allow the custom behavior we define to override the default one. For example, we can keep the default web configuration and only override the persistence configuration.

## Spring and Spring Boot
A critical thing to understand as we’re starting out here is the relation between Spring and Boot.

**Boot lives on top of the Spring framework.** So it’s not a question of using one or the other. Boot is, without a question, useful, and it does make things simple. But, in doing so, **it hides a lot of the internals of Spring**.

This makes it very easy to think you can ignore the internals, which is a risky way of developing an application. In any complex application, you’ll need to go beyond Boot. At that point, understanding the core of Spring is critical. Like any abstraction, you can’t really use it well without actually understanding the underlying layer.

We need to understand how the core pieces of Spring actually work, and more importantly, what Spring Boot does on top of them. Some of the core Boot features that allow the functionality we've discussed are:

* Create stand-alone Spring applications
* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
* Provide opinionated **starter** dependencies to simplify your build configuration
* Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
* Avoids code generation and XML configuration
