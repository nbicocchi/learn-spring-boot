# Exception Handling in the API

In this module, we’re going to see how exception handling is done in a REST API.

Specifically, we'll explore different mechanisms in Spring to handle exceptions gracefully and return a correct response back to the client.

The relevant module for this lesson is: [handling-exceptions-end](../code/learn-spring-m4/handling-exceptions-end)

## Throwing a _ResponseStatusException_

Add the following property to our application.properties file:

```
server.error.include-message=always
server.error.include-stacktrace=never
```

Let’s open the _ProjectController_ class in which we have been working the last lessons, and focus on the _findOne_ method:

```
@GetMapping(value = "/{id}")
public Project findOne(@PathVariable Long id) {
    Project project = projectService.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow( () -> new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND));
    return project;
}
```

Notice how we're throwing a _ResponseStatusException_ when the service isn't able to find the requested entity.

**The** **_ResponseStatusException_ provides a straightforward way to specify exactly what HTTP status code we'll send back to the client in a particular case.**

## Deploy and Test

If we launch the service and send a request using Postman to the _'Get by Id'_ endpoint with a non-existing _id_:

```
$ curl localhost:8080/projects/4
```

We receive a clear response; the status code is _404 Not Found_ and the body is a JSON with the right message:

```
{
    "timestamp": "2023-12-18T15:56:40.838+00:00",
    "status": 404,
    "error": "Not Found",
    "message": "404 NOT_FOUND",
    "path": "/projects/4"
}
```

Of course, throwing exceptions manually on a case-by-case basis has its disadvantages.

For one thing, the framework already throws a number of well-established exceptions, and we don't necessarily want to wrap those manually. Instead, we want to define what the client should get when these are thrown.

Another disadvantage is simply that throwing these exceptions manually will make our exception handling logic scattered and hard to understand.

**It would be a lot better to handle exceptions globally in a single location.**

With this objective, we'll set up a global exception handler.

We'll start by creating a new class, the _GlobalExceptionHandler,_ which will contain the logic to handle the different exceptions.

## Handling Exceptions Globally

**To make the handlers of this class effective globally for all _Controllers,_ we'll annotate this class with the _@ControllerAdvice_ annotation:**

```
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
  
}
```

**Now we can finally start to customize the behaviour of individual exceptions by using the _@ExceptionHandler_ annotation.**

The source or cause of the exception doesn't really matter; it can be our own exception coming out of the project's business logic, it can come out of the framework or from any other library on the stack.

Let's say we want to DELETE a non-existing entity. Typically, we'll obtain a 500 response caused by a DAO Exception, more precisely, an _EmptyResultDataAccessException._

We introduce this behavior by throwing the _NotFoundException_ explicitly in the _delete()_ method of the _ProjectServiceImpl_ class:

```
@Override
public Project findById(Long id) {
    Project project = projectRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow(
            () -> new NotFoundException(String.format("Project %d not found", id)));
    return project;
}

@Override
public void deleteById(Long id) {
    findById(id);
    projectRepository.deleteById(id);
}
```

Let's deploy the application and make the request using Postman:

```
$ curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/projects/4
```

We can confirm we get back a _500 Server Error_.

```
{
    "timestamp": "2024-02-21T17:00:56.523+00:00",
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "message": "Project 4 not found",
    "path": "/projects/4"
}
```

Let's have a look at the console to check which error is triggering this response: it's an _NotFoundException._ Let's handle this in our global exception handler.

We'll simply:

-   create a new method which will receive the exception as a parameter
-   annotate it with the _@ExceptionHandler_ annotation, and defining the exception class that will be handled as a parameter
-   define exactly what should happen in case this particular exception is triggered, in the method body:

```
@RestControllerAdvice
class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ResponseStatus(BAD_REQUEST)
    @ExceptionHandler(BadRequestException.class)
    public @ResponseBody HttpErrorInfo handleBadRequestExceptions(
            BadRequestException ex, WebRequest request) {
        return createHttpErrorInfo(BAD_REQUEST, request, ex);
    }

    @ResponseStatus(NOT_FOUND)
    @ExceptionHandler({ NotFoundException.class })
    public @ResponseBody HttpErrorInfo handleNotFoundExceptions(
            NotFoundException ex, WebRequest request) {
        return createHttpErrorInfo(NOT_FOUND, request, ex);
    }

    @ResponseStatus(UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)
    @ExceptionHandler(UnprocessableEntityException.class)
    public @ResponseBody HttpErrorInfo handleInvalidInputException(
            UnprocessableEntityException ex, WebRequest request) {
        return createHttpErrorInfo(UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, request, ex);
    }

    private HttpErrorInfo createHttpErrorInfo(
            HttpStatus httpStatus, WebRequest request, Exception ex) {
        final String path = request.getContextPath();
        final String message = ex.getMessage();
        return new HttpErrorInfo(httpStatus, path, message);
    }
}
```

```
public class HttpErrorInfo {
    private final ZonedDateTime timestamp;
    private final String path;
    private final HttpStatus httpStatus;
    private final String message;
    ...
}
```

Let's deploy the application and make the request using Postman:

```
$ curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/projects/4
```

We can confirm we get back a _500 Server Error_.

```
{
    "timestamp": "2024-02-21T17:56:18.310636+01:00",
    "path": "",
    "message": "Project 4 not found",
    "status": 404,
    "error": "Not Found"
}
```
