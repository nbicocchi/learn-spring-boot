# Spring Cloud Config

## Introduction

**Completely separating the configuration information from the application code allows developers and operations to make changes to their configurations without going through a recompile process**. It also introduces complexity, because now developers have another artifact to manage and deploy with the application.

**Many developers turn to property files** to store their configuration information. Configuring your application in these files becomes a simple task, so easy that most developers never do more than placing their configuration file under source control.

**This approach might work with a small number of applications, but it quickly falls apart when dealing with cloud-based applications that can contain hundreds of microservices**, where each microservice might have multiple service instances running.

To avoid this catastrophic scenario, as a best practice for cloud-based microservices development, we should consider the following:
* Completely separate the configuration of an application from the actual code being deployed.
* Build immutable application images that never change as these are promoted through your environments.
* Inject any application configuration information at server startup through either environment variables or a centralized repository that the microservices read on startup.

## Key principles
* **Segregate**: We need to completely separate the service configuration information from the actual physical deployment of a service. In fact, application configuration shouldn’t be deployed with the service instance. Instead, configuration information should either be passed as environment variables to the starting service or read from a centralized repository when the service starts.
* **Abstract**: We also need to abstract access to configuration data behind a service interface. Instead of writing code that directly reads the service repository, whether file-based or a JDBC database, we should use a REST-based JSON service to retrieve the application’s configuration data.
* **Centralize**: Because a cloud-based application might literally have hundreds of services, it’s critical to minimize the number of different repositories used to hold configuration data. Centralize your application configuration into as few repositories as possible.
* **Harden**: Because your application configuration information is going to be completely segregated from your deployed service and centralized, it’s critical that the solution you utilize and implement be highly available and redundant.

## Implementation choices

**etcd**

Written in Go. Used for service discovery and key-value management. Uses the raft protocol (https://raft.github.io/) for its distributed computing model.


* Very fast and scalable
* Distributable
* Command-line driven
* Easy to use and set up

**Eureka**

Written by Netflix. Extremely battle-tested. Used for both service discovery and key-value management.

* Distributed key-value store
* Flexible but takes some effort to set up
* Offers dynamic client refresh out of the box


**Consul**

Written by HashiCorp. Similar to etcd and Eureka but uses a different algorithm for its distributed computing model.

* Fast
* Offers native service discovery with the option to integrate directly with DNS
* Doesn’t offer client dynamic refresh out of the box

**Zookeeper**

An Apache project. Offers distributed locking capabilities. Often used as a configuration management solution for accessing key-value data.

* Oldest, most battle-tested of the solutions * Most complex to use
* Can be used for configuration management, but consider only if you’re already using Zookeeper in other pieces of your architecture

**Spring Cloud Configuration Server**

An open source project. Offers a general configuration management solution with different backends.

* Non-distributed key-value store
* Offers tight integration for Spring and non-Spring services
* Can use multiple backends for storing configuration data including a shared filesystem, Eureka, Consul, or Git

## Introduction to the Spring Cloud Config Server

When it comes to setting up a config server, there are a number of options to consider:
* Selecting a storage type for the configuration repository
* Deciding on the initial client connection, either to the config server or to the discovery server
* Securing the configuration, both against unauthorized access to the API and by avoiding storing sensitive information in plain text in the configuration repository

### Selecting the storage type of the configuration repository
Spring Cloud Config server supports the storing of configuration files in a number of different backends:
* Git repository
* Local filesystem
* HashiCorp Vault
* JDBC database

See the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/server.html) for the full list. In this chapter, we will use a local filesystem.

### Deciding on the initial client connection
By default, a client connects first to the config server to retrieve its configuration. Based on the configuration, it connects to the discovery server, to register itself. It is also possible to do this the other way around, that is, the client first connects to the discovery server to find a config server instance and then connects to the config server to get its configuration. There are pros and cons to both approaches.

Our clients will first connect to the config server. With this approach, it will be possible to store the configuration of the discovery server in the config server. One concern with connecting to the config server first is that the config server can become a single point of failure. If the clients connect first to a discovery server there can be multiple config server instances registered so that a single point of failure can be avoided. 

See https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/client.html#discovery-first-bootstrap for more details.

### Securing the configuration in transit
When the configuration information is asked for by a microservice, or anyone using the API of the config server, it will be protected against eavesdropping by the edge server since it already uses HTTPS. To ensure that the API user is a known client, we will use HTTP basic authentication. 

### Securing the configuration at rest
To avoid a situation where someone with access to the configuration repository can steal sensitive information, such as passwords, the config server supports the encryption of configuration information when stored on disk. The config server supports the use of both symmetric and asymmetric keys. Asymmetric keys are more secure but harder to manage.

### The Config Server API
The config server exposes a REST API that can be used by its clients to retrieve their configuration. We will use the following endpoints in the API:
* _/actuator_: The standard actuator endpoint exposed by all microservices. As always, these should be used with care. They are very useful during development but must be locked down before being used in production.
* _/encrypt_ and _/decrypt_: Endpoints for encrypting and decrypting sensitive information. These must also be locked down before being used in production.
* _/{microservice}/{profile}_: Returns the configuration for the specified microservice and the specified Spring profile.
We will see some sample uses for the API when we try out the config server.

## Setting up a config server

1. Create a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr to generate skeleton code.
2. Add Maven dependencies:

```
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
		</dependency>
	    <dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-config-server</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
		</dependency>
```

3. Add the configuration for the config server to the default property file, application.yml:

```
server.port: 8888
spring.application.name: config-server

spring.config.name: configserver
spring.security.user:
  name: ${CONFIG_SERVER_USR}
  password: ${CONFIG_SERVER_PWD}
#spring.profiles.active: native
spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations: file:${PWD}/code/learn-spring-m6/spring-cloud-config-end/config-repo
encrypt.key: ${CONFIG_SERVER_ENCRYPT_KEY}

# WARNING: Exposing all management endpoints over http should only be used during development, must be locked down in production!
management.endpoint.health.show-details: "ALWAYS"
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: "*"

logging:
  level:
    root: info

---
spring.config.activate.on-profile: docker
spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations: file:/config-repo
```

4. Add a Dockerfile and a definition of the config server to the Docker Compose file.

```
  config-server:
    build: config-server-end
    mem_limit: 512m
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker,native
      - ENCRYPT_KEY=${CONFIG_SERVER_ENCRYPT_KEY}
      - SPRING_SECURITY_USER_NAME=${CONFIG_SERVER_USR}
      - SPRING_SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD=${CONFIG_SERVER_PWD}
    volumes:
      - $PWD/config-repo:/config-repo
```

Here are the explanations for the preceding source code:
* The Spring profile _native_ is added to signal to the config server that the config repository is based on local files.
* The environment variable _ENCRYPT_KEY_ is used to specify the symmetric encryption key that will be used by the config server to encrypt and decrypt sensitive configuration information.
3. The environment variables _CONFIG_SERVER_USR_ and _CONFIG_SERVER_PWD_ are used to specify the credentials to be used for protecting the APIs using basic HTTP authentication.
4. The volumes declaration will make the config-repo folder accessible in the Docker container at /config-repo.

The values of the three preceding environment variables, marked in the Docker Compose file with ${...}, are fetched by Docker Compose from the .env file:

```
CONFIG_SERVER_ENCRYPT_KEY=ninna-nanna-ninna-0h
CONFIG_SERVER_USR=user
CONFIG_SERVER_PWD=secret
```

These environmental variables can be injected in IntelliJ Configurations using third party plugins such as EnvFile.


### Structuring the configuration repository
After moving the configuration files from each client’s source code to the configuration repository, we will have some common configuration in many of the configuration files, for example, for the configuration of actuator endpoints and how to connect to Eureka. 

The common parts have been placed in a common configuration file _application.yml_. 

This file is shared by all clients. The configuration repository can be found in _/config-repo_.

```
config-repo/
├── application.yml
├── eureka-server.yml
├── gateway-service.yml
├── composite-service.yml
├── date-service.yml
├── time-service.yml
└── gateway-service.yml
```

The most of these files are simple and similar to each because all common parts have been included in _application.yml_. Below you can see the content of _date-service.yml_.

```
server.port: 9001
spring.application.name: date-service

---
spring.config.activate.on-profile: docker
server.port: 8080
```

### Trying out the Spring Cloud Config Server
Now it is time to try out the config server:
1. Run both _EurekaServer_ and _ConfigServer_ 
2. Use the following command to retrive the _time-service_ configuration for the docker profile. You can test all the other combinations by changing the name either of the service or of the profile.

```
$ curl http://user:secret@localhost:8888/time-service/docker | jq

{
  "name": "time-service",
  "profiles": [
    "docker"
  ],
  "label": null,
  "version": null,
  "state": null,
  "propertySources": [
    {
      "name": "Config resource 'file [/Users/nicola/IdeaProjects/learn-spring-boot/code/learn-spring-m6/spring-cloud-config-end/config-repo/time-service.yml]' via location 'file:/Users/nicola/IdeaProjects/learn-spring-boot/code/learn-spring-m6/spring-cloud-config-end/config-repo/' (document #1)",
      "source": {
        "spring.config.activate.on-profile": "docker",
        "server.port": 8080
      }
    },
    ...
```

The response contains properties from a number of property sources, one per property file and Spring profile that matched the API request. The property sources are returned in priority order; if a property is specified in multiple property sources, the first property in the response takes precedence.

3. Information can be encrypted and decrypted using the /encrypt and /decrypt endpoints exposed by the config server. 

```
curl http://user:secret@localhost:8888/encrypt -d my-super-secure-password
4d28a7cb6eb9976dbeae0eb1cc0cb05672f01789140394fe4d93069d3622ab10a25ba9cf2b4ae3fcbc566dfb6cf13403%   
```

```
curl http://user:secret@localhost:8888/decrypt -d 4d28a7cb6eb9976dbeae0eb1cc0cb05672f01789140394fe4d93069d3622ab10a25ba9cf2b4ae3fcbc566dfb6cf13403
my-super-secure-password%    
```

## Setting up config server clients

1. Add Maven dependencies:
```
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>
```

2. Move the configuration file, application.yml, to the config repository and rename it with the name of the client as specified by the property _spring.application.name_.

3. Add a new application.yml file to the src/main/resources folder. This file will be used to hold the configuration required to connect to the config server. 

```
spring:
  application.name: time-service
  cloud.config:
    failFast: true
    retry:
      initialInterval: 3000
      multiplier: 1.3
      maxInterval: 10000
      maxAttempts: 20
    uri: http://localhost:8888
    username: ${CONFIG_SERVER_USR}
    password: ${CONFIG_SERVER_PWD}

---
spring.config.activate.on-profile: docker
spring.cloud.config.uri: http://config-server:8888

---
spring.config.activate.on-profile: connect
spring.config.import: "configserver:"
```

This configuration will make the client do the following:
* Connect to the config server using the http://localhost:8888 URL when it runs outside Docker, and using the http://config-server:8888 URL when running in a Docker container
* Use HTTP Basic authentication, based on the value of the CONFIG_SERVER_USR and CONFIG_SERVER_PWD properties, as the client’s username and password
* Try to reconnect to the config server during startup up to 20 times, if required. If the connection attempt fails, the client will initially wait for 3 seconds before trying to reconnect. The wait time for subsequent retries will increase by a factor of 1.3. The maximum wait time between connection attempts will be 10 seconds. If the client can’t connect to the config server after 20 attempts, its startup will fail
   
This configuration is generally good for resilience against temporary connectivity problems with the config server. It is especially useful when the whole landscape of microservices and its config server are started up at once, for example, when using the docker-compose up command. In this scenario, many of the clients will be trying to connect to the config server before it is ready, and the retry logic will make the clients connect to the config server successfully once it is up and running.
