# Exploring the Scopes of Spring Beans

In this lesson, we'll consider the different scopes of beans in Spring.

The relevant module for this lesson is: [scopes-of-spring-beans-end](../code/learn-spring-m2/scopes-of-spring-beans-end)

## Scopes of Beans

Basically, **Spring scopes allow us to control the life-cycle and visibility of beans**. When a bean is created, we can define its scope by means of the _@Scope_ annotation.

There are six types of bean scopes in Spring:

-   **_singleton_** - with this scope, the container creates a single instance of a bean. All requests for such a bean will return the same object, which is cached. This is the default scope if no other scope is specified.
-   **_prototype_** - with this scope, the container will create a new instance every time it’s requested.
-   **_request_**_,_ **_session_**_,_ **_application_**_,_ **_websocket_** - these scopes are available only in a web-aware application context and are less often used in practice. We’re have a look at these in a later lesson when we talk about web applications.

Let's now consider the first two scopes. We'll use the _ProjectRepositoryImpl_ class to create a bean for each scope.

## Singleton Scope

We've seen how to define a bean in a class decorated with the _@Configuration_ annotation. Let's open _LsAppConfig.java_ and define a bean with the singleton scope:

```
@Bean
public IProjectRepository singletonBean() {
    return new ProjectRepositoryImpl();
}
```

**This bean has the _singleton_ scope, since this is the default scope in Spring if we don’t specify any other.**

We could also specify it explicitly using the _@Scope_ annotation:

```
@Bean
@Scope("singleton")
public IProjectRepository singletonBean() {
    return new ProjectRepositoryImpl();
}
```

or

```
@Bean
@Scope(value = ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
public IProjectRepository singletonBean() {
    return new ProjectRepositoryImpl();
}
```

The 3 declarations above are equivalent.


## Prototype Scope

Now, let's define a bean with the scope prototype. To this end, we'll update the bean we've just created by changing the "singleton" scope and bean name into "prototype":

```
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public IProjectRepository prototypeBean() {
    return new ProjectRepositoryImpl();
}
```

## Understanding the Scopes

Now we'll demonstrate how these two scopes work. To this end, let’s create a single bean in _LsAppConfig_ class in a way that we have just seen:

```
@Bean
public IProjectRepository prototypeBean() {
    return new ProjectRepositoryImpl();
}
```

Note that, in order to avoid conflicts on bean injection, we need to comment out the _@Repository_ annotation in the _ProjectRepositoryImpl_ class.

Next, let's open the _ProjectServiceImpl_ class and inject a second instance of _ProjectRepositoryImpl:_

```
@Service
public class ProjectServiceImpl implements IProjectService {

    @Autowired
    private IProjectRepository projectRepository;

    @Autowired
    private IProjectRepository projectRepository2;
    
    // ...
    
}
```

In order to check how the beans are injected, in _ProjectServiceImpl_ we'll add a new method annotated with @_PostConstruct:_

```
@PostConstruct 
public void after() { 
    //
}
```

**Let's add a breakpoint in this method and start the application in debug mode.**

When the execution of the program stops at the breakpoint, we can see that _projectRepository_ and _projectRepository2_ actually refer to the same object in complete agreement with the definition of singleton.

If we now change the bean definition by specifying its scope as prototype:

```
@PostConstruct
public void after() {
}
```

And restart the application (in debug mode), we can see that those variables refer to different objects in complete agreement with the definition of prototype scope.
