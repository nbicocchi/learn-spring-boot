# What Is DI and How Does It Work in Spring?

In this lesson, we'll focus on understanding the concept of Dependency Injection (DI) and how this work in Spring.

## What Is Inversion of Control?

Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework. We most often use it in the context of object-oriented programming.

In contrast with traditional programming, in which our custom code makes calls to a library, IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code. To enable this, frameworks use abstractions with additional behavior built in. **If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.**

The advantages of this architecture are:
* decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
* making it easier to switch between different implementations
* greater modularity of a program
* greater ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking its dependencies, and allowing components to communicate through contracts

We can achieve Inversion of Control through various mechanisms such as: Strategy design pattern, Service Locator pattern, Factory pattern, and Dependency Injection (DI).


## Dependency Injection

Before we can talk about Dependency Injection, letâ€™s first define what a dependency is. Understanding this concept is critical not only for Spring, but for developing software in general. 

_Class A has a dependency on Class B when it interacts with it in any way_

One option is for Class A to take on the responsibility of instantiating B by itself:

```
public class A {
    private B bDependency;
  
    public A() {
        bDependency = new B();    
    }
}
```

Alternatively, that responsibility can be external, meaning the dependency comes from the outside:

```
public class A {
    private B bDependency;
    
    public A(B bDependency) {
        this.bDependency = bDependency;
    }
}
```

That is, in a nutshell, Dependency Injection (not to be confused with the the Dependency Inversion principle from SOLID).

**Injection is simply the process of injecting the dependency B in the object of type A.** Since the instantiation of the B dependency is no longer done in A, that responsibility will now belong to the framework. Separating the responsibility of instantiating a class from the logic in that class is a very useful concept:

* Leads to **a more loosely coupled system and to a lot of flexibility in the design** of that system, as now the dependency can be decided (or swapped out) at runtime.
* **Helpful in both application architecture, as well as testing, because DI make it easier to switch between different implementations of the dependency**. For example, we can pass in a mock of a dependency rather than a full dependency object.

## The Spring IoC Container
The interface `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the aforementioned beans. 

The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading configuration metadata. The configuration metadata is represented in XML, Java annotations, or Java code. It allows you to express the objects that compose your application and the rich interdependencies between such objects.

Several implementations of the `ApplicationContext` interface are supplied out-of-the-box with Spring. In standalone applications it is common to create an instance of [`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/api/org/springframework/context/support/ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.html) or [`FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/api/org/springframework/context/support/FileSystemXmlApplicationContext.html). 

**While XML has been the traditional format for defining configuration metadata you can instruct the container to use Java annotations or code** as the metadata format by providing a small amount of XML configuration to declaratively enable support for these additional metadata formats.

The following diagram is a high-level view of how Spring works. Your application classes are combined with configuration metadata so that after the `ApplicationContext` is created and initialized, you have a fully configured and executable system or application.
